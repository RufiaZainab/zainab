<dd>Shopping has become a hassle-free task now and almost anybody can order products online after comparison with other websites.

entry, data research, data management, etc. services are in demand. A person who is a Data scientist and data analyst is really important for innovative decision-making. Even the importance of Microsoft Excel in business is being realized by people now. Similarly, CRM and Google Analytics is helping businesses to analyze the consumer's behavior on the websites and advertising campaigns. Decision making is an important part of all kind of business and organizations. Success and failure depend on our decision. After the rise of online business and higher competition on the Internet to conduct business, it's really important that decisions do not be a burden on the organization. That's why today you can visualize, analyze and monitor customers data in real-time by using data analysis tools. That helps the business to remain competitive in the market by better data analysis. Any information we need regarding health, money, law, RTI, etc. everything is in front of us within a few seconds.

Indeed we are also using standardized communication protocols but the Internet evolves constantly by using artificial intelligence and search engines to find out how we communicate, how this can be made simpler for us to use and have a better experience in the shortest possible time.

<dt><b>7. International uses of the Internet by working remotely and providing business services:</dt></b>
<dd>It is obvious that the presence of the Internet has made doing business much easier. But it has also created its own set of challenges such as high competition, needs for quality content, etc. But knowledge is power and anyone can do business and job after learning more about it.  As the newer generations start to log into the Internet there are possibilities of completely new business and jobs. Nowadays the Internet is widely used in making money. If you have talent, then you can earn money by sitting at home on the Internet. It is hard to imagine how many people working in 9-5 jobs want to leave into jobs and work independently as freelancers or start their own Internet business. The emergence of websites such as Upwork.com, Freelancer websites has given people the option to work remotely (from home) according to their own schedule and commitment. Thousands of freelancer or professionals are doing this on a daily basis to earn more than their bread and butter cost.  Facebook business pages, Google AdWords, Paytm, blogs, YouTube channels, Amazon and other affiliate marketing methods are various tools used to make money by providing things of value to Internet users.

<dt><b>9. Uses of the Internet in Everyday Politics:</dt></b>
<dd>Internet is a great tool for politicians to connect with people. The uses of the Internet are not only in personal and business life but it is common now in politics. Politicians are using various methods to influence people and youth on social media to favor their party. They are also using it to criticize other political parties. Our Prime Minister of India Mr Narender Modi and Chief Minister of Delhi Mr Arvind Kejriwal are very active with their followers on Twitter and Facebook and sharing views on a particular topic. It is a widely accepted fact that Mr. Modi's success is largely attributed to his presence on social media and an active social media team. It is also good for people to know about the progress of ministers on a particular task. If governing political parties use social media to show the progress of their work then it is great. But if they are only using for condolence purposes then I think they have to think again about their social media political strategies. </dd>  




<dt><b>10. Uses of the Internet for Teaching and Sharing Knowledge with others:</dt></b>
<dd>The Internet is a very important tool for educators. The Internet and its application is user-friendly and make students life easy. A teacher can use YouTube channels to teach students around the world. Teachers can use the blog in which they can share their career experiences with college graduates. There are various websites for teachers such as Skillshare, udmey, etc. If you're free and want to spend your time doing productive things then create your own website. In the website, you can train people about the skills you're a master in.</dd>
